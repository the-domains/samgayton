# Favourite First Lines

I don't know about you, but I love the first lines of books. There's something extra special about a_first _line. I mean, you only get_one _first line per book. Even JK Rowling -- with all her millions of fans and all her thousands of pages and all her hundreds of characters -- even_she _has only got_eight _first lines.

That's why I love them. Because they're exceptionally _rare_.

Reading a great first line is like stepping into a kitchen where something delicious is bubbling away, and having a sniff. It should make you hungry, but at the same time, almost make you feel like you're full up. That's what a first line is. Something that reaches deep down in your stomach and sets your whole body rumbling.

If I go into a bookshop, I always pick up books, searching for a good first line. I have a list of my favourites.[Tell][0]me yours too, and if they're good enough, I might add them to this page!

First Lines by Children I visited at City of London School July 2013

"We went to the moon to have fun, but the moon turned out to completely suck." ---_Feed,_ by M.T. Anderson.

_This is my favourite ever first line. It's funny and horrifying, clever and stupid, poetic but simple all at once. It still gives me shivers. M.T. Anderson is a great writer._

"Something was upsetting the angels." ---_A Web of Air, _by Philip Reeve.

_So mysterious and unexpected. Angels? You mean they're real? But what could upset an ANGEL? It's ominous but also quirky. And we have to know the answer. Philip Reeve is a writer who just gets more masterful with each book._

"It was the day my grandmother exploded." ---_The Crow Road, _by Iain Banks.

_Wow. What I love about this one is how boring it is until the last word, then... BOOM! You what?! She EXPLODED? HOW??? It's a wicked, nasty, hilarious, spooky line -- it really could have been written by Roald Dahl._
